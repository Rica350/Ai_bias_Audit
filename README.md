# Bias Audit Report: Hiring Dataset  
_A machine learning fairness audit with bias detection, mitigation, and visualization_  

## 📌 Overview  
This project conducts a **bias audit on a hiring dataset** to analyze gender-related bias in hiring decisions. Using machine learning and fairness frameworks, the project evaluates **fairness metrics**, applies **bias mitigation techniques**, and visualizes results for stakeholder communication.  

The goal is to ensure **responsible AI adoption** in recruitment by detecting and addressing discriminatory patterns in automated decision-making systems.
